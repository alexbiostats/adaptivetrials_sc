In this module we introduce the concept of seamless designs, where we intentionally write a single study protocol to span multiple stages to reduce the time to evaluate the phases of research.\n\n\n# Slide Deck\n\n<iframe class=\"speakerdeck-iframe\" style=\"border: 0px; background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) padding-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0px 5px 40px; width: 100%; height: auto; aspect-ratio: 560 / 315;\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://speakerdeck.com/player/3454094432fb4971b71e8e61c7be57f1\" title=\"Seamless Trial Designs\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" data-ratio=\"1.7777777777777777\"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou can also download the [original PowerPoint file](../files/Slides/10_seamless_designs.pptx).\n\n\n# Code Examples in R\n\nThe one R package that comes up for seamless designs is:\n\n* [`asd`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/asd/): runs simulations for adaptive seamless designs with and without early outcomes for treatment selection and subpopulation type designs\n\n\n# References\n\nBelow are some references to highlight based on the slides and code:\n\n* [FDA Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics Guidance for Industry Guidance Document](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/adaptive-design-clinical-trials-drugs-and-biologics-guidance-industry): FDA guidance document on adaptive trial elements\n\n* [Recent innovations in adaptive trial designs: A review of design opportunities in translational research](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-clinical-and-translational-science/article/recent-innovations-in-adaptive-trial-designs-a-review-of-design-opportunities-in-translational-research/614EAFEA5E89CA035E82E152AF660E5D?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=bookmark): 2023 review paper examining adaptive and novel trial elements with included case studies\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n```{r, echo = FALSE}\nknitr::opts_chunk$set(\n  message = FALSE,\n  echo = TRUE\n)\n```\n\n\n# Overview\n\nClinical trials progress through a series of phases to evaluate safety and dose finding (Phase I), preliminary efficacy and further safety profiling (Phase II), and confirmatory efficacy and safety profiling (Phase III).
