In this module we review design elements that allow us to refine the eligibility of a study during interim analyses to \"enrich\" the study sample for subgroups that may be more likely to benefit or demonstrate an effect for our chosen outcome.\n\n\n# Slide Deck\n\n<iframe class=\"speakerdeck-iframe\" style=\"border: 0px; background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1) padding-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; border-radius: 6px; box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2) 0px 5px 40px; width: 100%; height: auto; aspect-ratio: 560 / 315;\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"https://speakerdeck.com/player/05192db116a04b7e9e9d9c757a17066a\" title=\"Adaptive Enrichment Designs\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" data-ratio=\"1.7777777777777777\"></iframe>\n\n&nbsp;\n\nYou can also download the [original PowerPoint file](./files/Slides/5_adaptive_enrichment.pptx).\n\n\n# Code Examples in R\n\nA few R packages that are noted to handle adaptive enrichment designs include:\n\n* [`rpact`](https://www.rpact.org/): a package for confirmatory adaptive clinical trial design, simulation, and analysis; includes some [vignettes](https://www.rpact.org/vignettes/planning/rpact_enrichment_designs_simulation_rates/) for conducting enrichment studies with the software\n* [`esDesign`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/esDesign/index.html): implement adaptive enrichment designs, potentially with sample size re-estimation, as proposed by [Lin et al. (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.cct.2020.106216)\n\n\n# References\n\nBelow are some references to highlight based on the slides and code:\n\n* [FDA Adaptive Design Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics Guidance for Industry Guidance Document](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/adaptive-design-clinical-trials-drugs-and-biologics-guidance-industry): FDA guidance document on adaptive trial elements\n\n* [Recent innovations in adaptive trial designs: A review of design opportunities in translational research](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-clinical-and-translational-science/article/recent-innovations-in-adaptive-trial-designs-a-review-of-design-opportunities-in-translational-research/614EAFEA5E89CA035E82E152AF660E5D?utm_campaign=shareaholic&utm_medium=copy_link&utm_source=bookmark): 2023 review paper examining adaptive and novel trial elements with included case studies\n",
