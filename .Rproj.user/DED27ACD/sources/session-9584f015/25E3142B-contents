# Overview

Traditionally we have designed separate, standalone trials to evaluate an intervention, even if there may be commonalities to ongoing and related studies. Master protocols serve as a flexible solution to this sometimes redundant approach to trials. In this module we discuss *basket trials* that allow multiple indications for a common intervention, *umbrella trials* that attempt to target eligible disease states for personalized therapy, and *platform trials* that allow for the evaluation of multiple therapies and populations.

# Code Examples in R

While master protocols themselves can be analyzed with general software, some special packages that incorporate other elements include:

* [`basket`](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/basket/index.html): implements asymmetric multi-source exchangeability models (MEMs) for basket trial designs where we wish to evaluate if pooling subgroups is possible based on exchangeability, restricted to binary outcomes
* [`NCC`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NCC/): provides functions to implement and evaluate platform trials with non-concurrent controls
* [`PlatformDesign`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/PlatformDesign/index.html): design parameters for two-period multiarm platform designs
